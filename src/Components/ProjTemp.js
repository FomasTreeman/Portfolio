              This is my first use of 3D software, i have had experience with
              adobe illustrator and photoshop through a Graphic Design course i
              took at college, but they were 2D. I have yet to play more with
              animation and 3D modelling, but at the moment i'm focusing on
              broadening my skill set to find what i enjoy and thrive at. But
              here is that first attempt at 3D 'modelling' using three.js
              library.

              This is a simulation to replicate the behaviour of flocks of
              birds. It follows three rules; separation, alignment, cohesion.
              Separation - each bird attempts to maintain even spacing among its
              neighbouring birds. Alignment - each bird tries to gradually
              follow the same vector as neighbouring birds. Cohesion - each bird
              ties to move towards the average position of other neighbouring
              birds (countering separation to create an average position).

              locally installed), and recommends the next thing to watch
              according to what youâ€™ve viewed previously.
